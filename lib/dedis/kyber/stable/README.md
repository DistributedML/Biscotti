# Creating a stable version of kyber

With the current development-model, `master` should stay in a more or
less stable state, but it has extensions that are not deemed stable.
This directory allows to extract the *stable* parts of kyber to be included
in a `v1` or other package-handling procedure.

To create the stable version of kyber, use:

```bash
make create_stable
```
