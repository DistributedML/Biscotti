DEDIS Advanced Crypto Library for Go
====================================

This package provides a toolbox of advanced cryptographic primitives for Go,
targeting applications like [Cothority](https://github.com/dedis/cothority)
that need more than straightforward signing and encryption.
Please see the
[Godoc documentation for this package](http://godoc.org/gopkg.in/dedis/kyber.v2)
for details on the library's purpose and API functionality.

How to Get the Stable Version
-----------------------------

The stable version of Kyber should be imported using:

```
   import "gopkg.in/dedis/kyber.v2"
```

Other versions:
* gopkg.in/dedis/crypto.v0 was the previous semi-stable version. See
  [migration notes](https://github.com/dedis/kyber/wiki/Migration-from-gopkg.in-dedis-crypto.v0).
* kyber.v1 never existed, in order to keep kyber, onet and cothorithy versions linked
* the master branch of kyber is the development version

Installing
----------

First make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org) version 1.8 or newer installed.

The basic crypto library requires only Go and a few
third-party Go-language dependencies that can be installed automatically
as follows:

	go get gopkg.in/dedis/kyber.v2
	cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/gopkg.in/dedis/kyber.v2
	go get -t ./... # install 3rd-party dependencies

You should then be able to test its basic function as follows:

	go test -v

You can recursively test all the packages in the library as follows:

	go test -v ./...

Constant Time Implementation
----------------------------

By default, this package builds groups that implements constant time arithmetic
operations. Currently, only the Edwards25519 group has a constant time implementation,
and thus by default only the Edwards25519 group is compiled in.

If you need to have access to variable time arithmetic groups such as P256 or
Curve25519, you need to build the repository with the "vartime" tag:

    go build -tags vartime

And you can test the vartime packages with:

    go test -tags vartime ./...

When a given implementation provides both constant time and variable time
operations, the constant time operations are used in preference to the variable
time ones, in order to reduce the risk of timing side-channel attack.
See [AllowsVarTime](https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/dedis/kyber.v2#AllowsVarTime) for how
to opt-in to variable time implementations when it is safe to do so.

A note on deriving shared secrets
---------------------------------

Traditionally, ECDH (Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman) derives the shared secret
from the x point only. In this framework, you can either manually retrieve the
value or use the MarshalBinary method to take the combined (x, y) value as the
shared secret. We recommend the latter process for new softare/protocols using
this framework as it is cleaner and generalizes across different types of
groups (e.g., both integer and elliptic curves), although it will likely be
incompatible with other implementations of ECDH. See [the Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman) on ECDH.
