## Run the following biscotti runs with a different number of nodes

bash runBiscotti.sh 3 60 hosts_diffDC mnist
# save LogFiles
bash runBiscotti.sh 2 40 hosts_diffDC mnist
# save LogFiles
bash runBiscotti.sh 4 80 hosts_diffDC mnist
# save LogFiles
bash runBiscotti.sh 5 100 hosts_diffDC mnist
# save LogFiles

#Once results are in, generate graphs
